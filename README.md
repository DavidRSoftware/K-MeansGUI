# K-MeansGUI
During my Artificial Intelligence course at Queens College in the Spring semester of 2016 I worked on a group project together with two other classmates. We split up the workload of the project among ourselves and I successfully designed a graphic user interface which recorded userâ€™s choices with text boxes and drop down lists and displayed output with the click of a button. Our group used GitHub to help us communicate to each other our progress in writing code. I designed the graphical user interface using Java. This group project involved using K-Means Clustering to provide practical business advice to a chain store that wishes to open up a branch in a new location. K-Means Clustering is a useful method in statistical data analysis that has many practical applications. This repository only contains the code that I designed myself but you can view the complete group project at https://github.com/TeslaSoftware/K-MeansForBusiness where I was responsible for designing the ButtonHandler.java class as well as the States.java and the Driver.java class.
